## Project Description

Solsikke is a video game designed to teach people about the concept of death in an approachable and sensitive way. The game takes players on a journey of grief as they accompany the main character, an old man, on a quest to save his deceased wife. Through a series of levels, each representing a stage of grief, players navigate emotional challenges, interact with companions, and discover letters from the wife that provide guidance and comfort. Solsikke aims to address the serious topic of death while maintaining a balanced tone that is not overwhelmingly sad, making it suitable for young players.
